# Overview
In this project, I will document the process of creating a **C**yber**s**ecurity **L**ab at home. The goal is to establish an environment protected from potential attacks or exploits that an external malicious user might try to take advantage of. I will be building this from scratch and will make sure to document every single step, as I believe this will help me reflect better when I want to update or change something. 
<br><br>
This is not a tutorial or guide, just a documentation of my work and progress, the way I approach it.
I want to mention that you don’t have to follow every step exactly as I did. I’ll be documenting everything, including some details that may not be strictly necessary.

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> It is possible that my documentation and project may contain some mistakes or errors. Therefore, some prior knowledge of the topic is necessary to ensure clarity and avoid confusion.

# Concept
Before starting, I created a prototype of the network plan using [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/). The goal was to visualize my ideas and ensure that everything could be connected logically. I didn’t focus much on design, as I wanted to confirm the plan’s feasibility before refining its appearance.

These are some of the points I wanted to include in my Cybersecurity Lab:

- Containers
- Kali Linux
- Firewall / monitoring tools
- Private network for protection from external threats
  - IP configuration
  - Subnetting
  - Possible Testing Environment
